# Official Documentation for Alternative Data Sources

## Why Alternative Data is Trending

Alternative data refers to any non-traditional data source that provides unique insights into the financial markets. Unlike traditional market data, which is limited to price, volume, and open/close data, alternative data sources offer information from various fields such as social media, consumer behavior, satellite imagery, and more. The rise in alternative data has revolutionized investment strategies by providing a broader perspective on market movements and future trends. Investors are increasingly relying on these data sets to make informed decisions.
